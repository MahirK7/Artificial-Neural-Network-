# Artificial-Neural-Network-
Created an Artificial Neural Network solving a Classification problem using a Horseshoe Database.

Tasks to be undertaken:
The aim of this project is to develop and test a shallow neural network model to be
able to calculate external curve length of horse shoes based on:
• Internal Curve Length
• Width Length
• Cord Length
• Curve Length
In order to develop this neural network model, you will use the provided Horse
Shoe Data set
In order to simplify things, the construction of the neural network model will be
based entirely (training and testing) on measurements of 219 horse shoes.
Task
You have a number of tasks:
• Grab the data set from the web site to produce a data set for training and
testing your neural network.
•Split the available data sets for training and testing the neural network. It is
up to you to decide what percentage of images you leave for training and
testing.
•Train and test a neural network that can predict the length of the external
curve of the horse shoe.
We will be looking for:
•Sensible data manipulation.
•Sensible choice of training and test data.
•Appropriate choice of network topology.
•Careful thought about the various design parameters for a neural network.
